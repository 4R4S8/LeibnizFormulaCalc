Pi is 3.14159 to 5 decimal places.
To work out Pi, we will be using Leibniz’s formula:
X = 4 – 4/3 + 4/5 – 4/7 + 4/9 – …
This series converges to Pi, the more terms that are added to the series, the closer the value is to Pi.
For the proof on why this series converges to Pi – https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_Formula_for_Pi
